# X-states
Unveiling entanglement with ML

This code creates/compares binary classifiers to distinguish between quantum Xstate vs non Xstate.

One code compares various scikit-learn classifiers performance on this task ( plot_Xstate_comparison_algorithms_prof.py ).

The other creates a raw TensorFlow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier to distinguish between quantum Xstate vs non Xstate  ( rawTF_DL_Xstate_clf.py ).
